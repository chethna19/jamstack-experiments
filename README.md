JAMstack Experiments
====================

This repository probably gets deleted quite soon, but feel free to explore.

I explore JAMstack with Netlify CMS in separate branches which started as orphans. Well, thereâ€™s [only one][middleman-branch] for now. It explores Middleman as a static generator with Haml templates.
