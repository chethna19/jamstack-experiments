JAMstack Experiments
====================

This repository probably gets deleted quite soon, but feel free to explore.

I’m exploring JAMstack with Netlify CMS and different static site generators in separate branches which started as orphans:

* [Middleman][middleman-branch] – Haml, Sass and self-hosted Netlify CMS via NPM
* [Jekyll][jekyll-branch] – defaults for now
